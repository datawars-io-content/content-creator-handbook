## Introduction

This guide will walk you through the process of creating **assessment projects** (also referred to as **batch projects**) for specific skills. These assessments are designed to evaluate a learnerâ€™s understanding of a skill through a set of well-structured activities aligned with predefined learning objectives.

For each skill, we define a set of objectives that outline the key areas of focus. Your task is to create ** atleast 25 activities** that are distributed across these objectives. This ensures that the assessment comprehensively covers both conceptual understanding and related coding tasks.

The guide covers how to structure your GitHub repository, write the necessary files (like `assessment.json` and `English.md`), and organize activities under each objective to create a smooth and effective learning assessment experience.
