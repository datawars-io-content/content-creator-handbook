At DataWars, we put a lot of emphasis on creating content of extremely good quality, so the final process of testing is key for us.

Testing is also a great way to re-inforce your skills, you're learning and practicing at the same time. Here's what you need to know about our process.

### Preliminaries

You'll have access to our private discord channel and you'll share it with other project Authors. So you'll have direct access to both the project author and DataWars staff. You'll also have some priviledged access to some private features we have developed for project creation.

**IMPORTANT:** All your reports and reviews are kept PRIVATE and are not accessible by project authors, they're only seen by DataWars staff. Make sure your reports are accurate and faithful with DataWars' vision of amazing projects.

### Testing Process

The process of testing is divided into 2 main phases; a "technical" one in which you'll make sure the project and the activities work correctly, they make sense to you, etc. And a second one related to the quality of said project. Both these processes finish with a report that you have to send us.

##### 1. Technical Phase
You'll be assigned a project that is candidate to be published. In the eyes of the project author the project is ready, so you should treat it like so. **You should put yourself in the shoes of a user solving the project for the first time**. The project will not include the solutions and you must solve the entire project by yourself.

What should you be looking for?

* Is the project correctly explained? Is the general sense of the project and data understandable?
* Are the activities correctly written and explained? Can you understand and resolve them?
* Have you found any typos overall? (see GPT Tools below)
* Is the lab correctly set? The data can be read. If it's a Jupyter lab, the right cells are created with the right placeholders, etc.
* Any other issues that you might find related to the general resolution of the project.

Any issues you find in the activities, you must report them using the "Report Issue" button of each activity.

If the issue is unrelated to any of the activities, you can still use the Report Issue of one of the activities and tell the project author in the comments what's the broad issue.

At the end of the review you must submit your report using the following form: [https://forms.gle/Ua1KdKU7hsHFZHz77](https://forms.gle/Ua1KdKU7hsHFZHz77)

Take a look at the form, as you'll need to keep track of a few things while you're testing the project, including:

* Total resolution time: how long did it take you to solve the project
* Perecived difficulty: how easy/hard you FELT this project was. This is entirely subjective, we want to know your impressions about this project's difficulty
* General rating/impression of the project: how good do you think the project is overall?
* etc.

##### <Interlude> General fixes of the project

This is an intermediate phase in which the project author starts solving the issues you reporting. They must ask you for clarifications, etc.

##### 2. Final Testing

Once all your issues have been fixed and the author has marked the project as "READY to go again", you'll need to perform the final testing. This time, the solutions of the activities will be provided. It's your job to also make sure the solutions are working correctly and they make sense, are correctly formatted, well explained, etc.

This phase finishing by you sending the following report: [https://forms.gle/Huf4KC13JX47GSGaA](https://forms.gle/Huf4KC13JX47GSGaA)
