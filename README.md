# DataWars - Content Creator Handbook

This is the starting point for all our Lab writers and content creators. Part of our culture is to be process-driven, so our objective is that all your questions should be answered here. If there's anything missing, we'd love to hear about it so we can write it and help future creators. You can email me at any time at sbasulto@datawars.io.

# <a id="toc-goal-mission"></a>DataWars Goal and Mission

DataWars mission is to advance Data Science/Analysis/Engineering training in a hands-on way. Our main goal is to provide hands-on projects so our students can acquire and practice skills in an interactive form: project-driven learning.

We want to break the traditional education paradigm in which learning and practice (application of what was learned) are separated in different phases. Instead, we want to combine both: learning and application.

A typical project of DataWars will explain a given concept and immediately provide interactive activities so students can practice and apply those concepts. This helps the student solidify the concepts and understand if they have any knowledge gaps.

The process is as follows:

```
Explain > Practice > Challenge > Explain > Practice > Challenge > ...
```

> Related: See [Activity Types](#todo) to learn what types of interactive activities you can use in your labs to test your student's understanding.


# <a id="toc-project-structure"></a>General Structure of a Project

A project is a combination of "learning content" + an interactive "lab". The learning content is just text that you provide for your students to follow along.

This learning content is a combination of rich text (images, links, formatting options like bold fonts, italics, etc) and embedded activities. The content is broken up in different pages or "sections" to simplify the consumption for the student. Read more about this in the [Content Portion of a Lab](#todo).

The interactive lab is a combination of different devices that your student employs to learn/practice/evidence the skills/concepts. It can be a Jupyter instance, a MySQL Database, a Linux server, etc.

# <a id="toc-types-of-projects"></a>Types of Projects

DataWars includes a combination of three types of projects:

* Learn Projects
* Practice Projects
* Capstone Projects

Each fulfills a different function within the Learning Experience of our students.

## <a id="toc-learn-projects"></a>Learn Projects

The objective of this project type is to drive concepts and for the student to learn and apply them. It includes a lot more guidance while explaining the subjects.

After each new concept is introduced, we recommend to add different activities to solidify those concepts. So, for example, if we're teaching basic math we'd have the following sections.

```
- Introduction
- Additions
    - Activity: practice 2 + 2
    - Activity: practice 3 + 4
- Subtractions
    - Activity: practice 5 - 2
    - Activity: practice 9 - 1
etc...
```

An example of a Learn Project is: [Intro to Pandas Series](https://beta.datawars.io/module/82e51088-2737-4e63-b5a1-7680b3ef3c95)

## <a id="toc-practice-projects"></a>Practice Projects

As the name implies, these projects are about practicing and solidifying concepts. They contain a lot less guidance, it's all about different activities to practice the skills.

The activities' solutions will generally contain explanations referring to the learning portion.

An example of a Practice Project is: [Practicing filtering sorting with Pokemon](https://beta.datawars.io/module/e7ab30b3-6b76-4f7c-a69e-048a09dc804b)

## <a id="toc-capstone-projects"></a>Capstone Projects

Capstone projects are Practice Projects but combining multiple skills.
