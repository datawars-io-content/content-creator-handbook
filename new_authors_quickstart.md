### 1) Values and Projects

Our core value at DataWars is to create amazing, entertaining and engaging projects for our students. Something people enjoy resolving and gives them a sense of achievement.

Most DataWars users work full time jobs, so they practice in their free hours at night or during their weekends. They're probably tired, mentally burned, and with pressures to do other things with their free time. So that's why creating interesting and entertaining projects is our key differentiator.

But, what makes a project **AMAZING**? everybody can download a dataset from Kaggle and create a few activities about "remove null values from here", "create a groupby there". What separates an average project from an outstanding project are the following three characteristics:

####  1.1) Interesting and entertaining
As mentioned before, finding a dataset out there and asking a few questions is simple. Great projects have the characteristic that they combine interesting scenarios and datasets with the learned skill. They spark curiosity and indirectly explain other concepts related to the skill. Check the examples of great projects below and you'll see this in action. For example, the project about IP Addresses not only helps the student practice pandas, it also (indirectly) teaches them how IP Addresses work. The project about the Sunken Sailor has a **story** behind that makes it more engaging. The NLP Project deals with data cleaning, but indirectly also shows students that these techniques will be used in their Machine Learning future.


#### 1.2) Well explained and cohesive
Great projects start with a good introduction that concessively explains the objectives of the project and the data used (if any). For example, the Filtering Pokemon project has a very clear explanation of what the project covers. The explanations are concise and to the point, without any language waste. We recommend NOT to copy-paste from GPT for example, as it's usually full of unnecessary hyperboles, adverbs and adjectives. Instead, you can combine GPT with something like [the Hemingway App](https://hemingwayapp.com/).

#### 1.3) They follow the FLOW Theory

This is one of the **MOST IMPORTANT** concepts at DataWars. If you don't know what [FLOW](https://w.wiki/DKT) is, you can learn more [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUsOCR1KKms) ([or this other one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znwUCNrjpD4)).

Briefly, FLOW is a state in which we "walk" the student through a process of solving a project, slowly increasing the difficulty while also giving them more satisfaction with any new activity resolved. Projects have to be challenging enough to spark interest, but activities have to be bite-sized an achievable not to frustrate students. Here's the FLOW diagram, which shows exactly this:

FLOW gives us concrete directions on how to write projects:

1. Activities have to be achievable but challenging
2. Activities are scoped enough that a student has to be able to **concentrate** on it and on it only
3. An activity has clear goals and explanations, without room for interpretation
4. Activities provide immediate feedback. They're not subjective. You either did it right or not.
5. Deep and engaging on the problem, the student can fully focus on the current activity
6. The student has a sense of control: they know they'll be able to solve the activity if they write the right code.
7. Sense of duration: the project has a given scope and it BEGINS and ENDS in very clear limits.

### Examples of good projects

Here's a list of outstanding projects in our platform for you to have a reference. The characteristics that make a project great are:

- [The sunken sailor and the hidden message](https://app.datawars.io/project/02a0e765-175a-48cb-89ba-60bddf1f289f?page=1): entertaining project with an original back story.
- [Finding Mersenne primes with Python](https://app.datawars.io/project/f962f444-57c3-4234-8a06-e48b9a8bb57a): an interesting project combining real world concepts with Python programming practice. It not only helps someone practice Python, it also sparks the curiosity with the concept of Mersenne Primes.

#### Data Analysis with Pandas

- [Practicing filtering sorting with Pokemon](https://app.datawars.io/project/54b07e96-f0da-4b5d-ba40-c87475e42b8e): a very concise and well explained project, the activities get more entertaining and challenging as the project progresses. Great example of Flow.
- [Analyzing newborn given names in Argentina](https://app.datawars.io/project/b4c63618-70e3-4233-92ad-4f12cbfbe0e8?page=1). An interesting project communicating local/cultural phenomenons that spark curiosity and resonates with the users.

#### Data Cleaning

- [String pre-processing for Sentiment Analysis in NLP](https://app.datawars.io/project/15afa695-e8c6-4971-8c4d-1fc10feb17b4?page=1): this project is incredible as it shows the importance of the skills practiced and the applications of it. It goes with the flow with the guided, step by step, activities

#### Data Wrangling

- [IP Addresses Range per Country Analysis](https://app.datawars.io/project/6446c860-f72f-475f-b458-1e7add7d9fb8): a very interesting and project that sparks curiosity as it shows how IP Addresses and assignment works in the real world.

#### Machine Learning

- [Predicting intergalactic transportations with Spaceship Titanic](https://app.datawars.io/project/00ca7761-bc66-4fff-ad4f-be1ab61a5372?page=1): a guided, step by step project that guides the student to complete a classification task. This is a great example of the FLOW.
