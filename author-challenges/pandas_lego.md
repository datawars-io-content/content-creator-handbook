ðŸŽ¬ [Video Tutorial](https://www.loom.com/share/b5561c5135af4792b52299e9716145f6?sid=4256c385-0ac9-4357-b20c-191ff57c5d26)

This challenge is intended for people applying for our Content Leader role, in the Pandas/Data Analysis area.

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure you have already read ALL [our documentation about project creation](https://github.com/datawars-io-content/content-creator-handbook/blob/main/new_authors_quickstart.md) first. If you haven't yet, [start there](https://github.com/datawars-io-content/content-creator-handbook/blob/main/new_authors_quickstart.md).

#### 1) Go to Playgrounds and use the JupyterLab image

To submit your test, you have to use our [Playgrounds](https://app.datawars.io/playgrounds?tab=overview). You'll need access to a special image for Project creation, that is named "JupyterLab". If you DON'T have access. Let us know.

#### 3) Create your activities

Create between ~10/15 activities with whatever you think it's best, you can combine Data Analysis, Q&A, Data Cleaning, Visualizations, Data Wrangling etc. Extra points are awarded for manipulation of the dataset or if you enrich the project with other datasets. For example, you can upload a dataset of US Inflation and adjust the price of the Lego pieces by inflation. Or you can add extra rows to "mess" with the data and focus on Data Cleaning. These are just a few examples, but you can get as creative as possible.

#### 4) Publish your Playground
